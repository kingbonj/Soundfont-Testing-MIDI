The last major development before streaming music came in 1992: Roland Corporation released the first General MIDI card, the sample-based SCC-1, an add-in card version of the SC-55 desktop MIDI module.
MIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. It was first introduced in 1983 as a standard protocol for communication between electronic musical instruments and computers.
MIDI is not an audio format, but a data protocol that sends information about note pitch, duration, velocity, and other performance data between devices. The MIDI protocol can be transmitted over various interfaces, including USB, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi.
MIDI data can be recorded, edited, and played back using a wide range of software applications and hardware devices. It can also be used to control various aspects of a musical performance, including sound generation, effects processing, and lighting.
The MIDI specification has been updated several times since its initial release, with the most recent version being MIDI 2.0.
MIDI is an open standard, meaning that anyone can develop and implement MIDI-enabled hardware or software without paying licensing fees.

Despite being no longer in production, GUS cards and software are still used by some enthusiasts and retro gamers today, with a vibrant community of developers and users keeping the technology alive.
The Gravis Ultrasound line included several different models, including the original Gravis Ultrasound (GUS), GUS Classic, GUS Max, GUS ACE, and GUS Extreme. Each model offered improved features and capabilities over the previous one.
Later models of the GUS card, such as the GUS MAX and GUS ACE, increased the number of voices and sample rate, with the GUS MAX supporting up to 32-bit audio at 96 kHz. The GUS MAX also introduced hardware acceleration for wavetable synthesis, which greatly improved MIDI playback performance.
One notable feature of the GUS card was its support for SoundFonts, a format for storing digital audio samples used in MIDI playback. The GUS card was one of the first sound cards to support SoundFonts, and it quickly became a popular format for developers and musicians.
The Sound Blaster is a series of sound cards developed by Creative Labs in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The original Sound Blaster card was released in 1989 and featured a 8-bit DAC, 11-voice FM synthesizer, and a joystick port. Subsequent models, such as the Sound Blaster Pro, Sound Blaster 16, and Sound Blaster AWE, introduced improvements such as 16-bit audio, wavetable synthesis, and MIDI capabilities.
Sound Blaster cards were popular in the gaming and multimedia industries, as they provided high-quality audio for games and multimedia applications. The Sound Blaster 16, for example, was known for its compatibility with MS-DOS games and its ability to provide 16-bit audio at a time when many PCs still used 8-bit audio.
In addition to its hardware capabilities, Sound Blaster cards also included software such as Creative Labs' own Sound Blaster Control Panel, which allowed users to configure the card's settings and access various audio tools. The Sound Blaster also supported third-party software such as General MIDI-compatible synthesizers and digital audio editing software.
Today, the Sound Blaster name is still used by Creative Labs for its line of gaming headsets and external USB sound cards, which provide high-quality audio for gaming, music, and other multimedia applications.
The SoundCanvas was the first sound module to include the SoundCanvas Wave (SCW) format, which allowed for CD-quality audio playback on a MIDI module. This format was later supported by many music software programs, including Cakewalk and Cubase.

Many popular video game soundtracks from the 1990s used the Roland SoundCanvas, including Chrono Trigger, Final Fantasy VI, and Secret of Mana.
The Roland SoundCanvas has been discontinued, but its legacy lives on in the form of various software emulations and hardware reproductions, such as the Roland SoundCanvas VA software and the Roland SC-8820 hardware module.
MIDI soundtracks allowed for smaller file sizes compared to digital audio, which was important for early PC games with limited storage capacity.
MIDI files can be easily edited and remixed, allowing game composers to create variations on a theme and dynamically adjust the soundtrack to match gameplay events.
MIDI files can also be easily translated to different sound libraries, meaning that games could have consistent soundtracks across different soundcards and synthesizers.
Some game soundtracks were released as standalone MIDI files, allowing fans to create their own remixes and covers of their favorite tracks.
Despite their technical limitations, MIDI soundtracks can evoke powerful emotional responses in players and are still remembered fondly by many fans of classic games.
The use of MIDI soundtracks declined in the late 1990s and early 2000s with the rise of digital audio formats, but they continue to be used in some modern games for stylistic and nostalgic reasons.
MIDI soundtracks have inspired the creation of new genres of music, such as "video game music" and "chiptune", which pay homage to the sounds of classic game consoles and computers.
Type 0 MIDI files have all tracks combined into a single track. This means that all MIDI information is contained within one single file.
Type 1 MIDI files have separate tracks for each channel. This means that each track can be edited and played back independently.
Type 2 MIDI files are similar to Type 1 MIDI files, but with fewer tracks. This type of MIDI file is not as commonly used as Type 0 and Type 1.
SMF (Standard MIDI File) is a file format that stores MIDI data in a standardized way, making it easy for different software and hardware to read and play back MIDI files.
XMF (eXtensible Music Format) is an extension of SMF that allows for more complex MIDI data to be included in a file.
RMID (RIFF MIDI) is a type of MIDI file format that uses the RIFF (Resource Interchange File Format) container format. This allows for additional metadata to be included with the MIDI data.
